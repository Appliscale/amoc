# A Murder of Crows

A simple tool for running parallel XMPP tests

## Developing a scenario

All files related to scenarios should be placed in the `scenarios` directory.

A scenario specification is just an [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) module that
exposes the necessary callback functions.

A typical scenario file will look like this:

```erlang
-module(my_scenario).

-export([init/0]).
-export([start/1]).

init() ->
    %% initialize some metrics
    ok.

start(Id) ->
    %% connect user
    %% fetch user's history
    %% send some messages
    %% wait a little bit
    %% send some messages again
    ok.
```

The ``init/0`` function will be called only once per test run, at the very beginning.
It can be used for setting up necessary (global) state: metrics, database
connections, etc.

The ``start/1`` function describes the actual scenario and will be executed for
each user, in the context of that user's process.

``Id`` is the given user's unique integer id.
After this function returns, it will be executed again following some delay (60
seconds by default).

For developing XMPP scenarios, we recommend the
[esl/escalus](https://github.com/esl/escalus) library.

If additional dependencies are required by your scenario, a `rebar.config` file
can be created inside the `scenario` dir and `deps` from that file will be
merged with amoc's `deps`.

## Running a scenario

To start your scenario, execute the following:

```bash
./rebar get-deps  # This is needed only for the first run
./run.sh my_scenario 1 1000
```

These commands will fetch all the required dependencies, compile all the
source files and scenarios.

The scenario ``my_scenario`` will be started in an Erlang interactive shell,
running with user ids from 1 to 1000.
